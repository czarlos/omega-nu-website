Current Developer Notes:

1. Setting up the DB (locally)
	a. Spin up a mongod
	b. Open the mongo console and create a database "test" with a collection "users"
	c. Import the current users from the JSON file using the ruby import script (db dump later)
2. Lots of hacky front-end javascript, lots of work to be done there. This is a great place to contribute!
